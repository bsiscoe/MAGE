#MAGE Engine - 
Modular Architecture for Graphics and Effects
This module serves as the main entry point for the MAGE Engine, providing
initialization and access to core components like the engine and controls.

First run: npm install mage-1.0.0.tgz

```javascript
import { initMAGE } from 'mage';

Create a MAGE object with the desired configuration options. For example:
const {engine, controls} = initMAGE({
  canvas,
  withControls = true,
  autoStart = false,
  options = { log: true },
})
```

The returned object includes the initialized engine and controls (if created) for further use in your application.
i.e.
```javascript
engine.start() -> Starts rendering inside the canvas element (begins as default preset)
engine.loadPreset(MAGEPreset.SOME_PRESET_JSON) -> Loads a preset from a JSON object or URL
engine.loadAudio('path/to/audio/file.mp3') -> Loads audio from a URL or file
engine.play() -> Plays the currently loaded audio (if not already playing)
engine.pause() -> Pauses the currently playing audio
engine.toPreset() -> returns the current preset as a MAGEPreset instance
```
